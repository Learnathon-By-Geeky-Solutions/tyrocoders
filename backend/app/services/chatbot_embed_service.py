    Service class responsible for managing chatbot embedding functionality.
    
    This class provides methods for creating, retrieving, and managing embedded
    chatbot instances that can be integrated into external platforms or websites.

    the chatbot system and external platforms.

    Note:
        This service relies on UserCrud and UserService for user validation,
        and ChatbotService for chatbot-specific operations. It returns
        standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes for
        API consistency.
        
    Example:
        >>> embed_service = ChatbotEmbedService()
        >>> response = await embed_service.generate_embed_code(user_id, chatbot_id)
